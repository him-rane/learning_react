A CDN (Content Delivery Network) is a distributed network of servers that work together to deliver web content to users faster and more efficiently. React is a popular JavaScript library used for building user interfaces. When used together, a CDN can help improve the performance and scalability of a React application by caching and delivering static assets from the CDN's edge servers, closer to the user. This can reduce the load on the origin server and improve the overall user experience.
